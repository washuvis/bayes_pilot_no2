<h2>Reasoning Study Instructions</h2>

<p>
<strong>Part I: Word Selection Task</strong><br><br>
First, you will complete a series of word selection tasks. A <b>word selection task</b> consists of a scrolling list of words moving at a certain speed. Your task will be to select as many <b>fruits</b> as possible in the list of words while avoiding the words that are not fruits. If you make a mistake, you can unselect a word by clicking on it. If your score on the task is satisfactory, you will move on to the next level. Once this task is over, you will be redirected to the <b>Bayesian tasks</b>.<br><br>

<strong>Part II: Bayesian Reasoning + Word Selection Task followed by questionaire</strong><br><br>

In the Bayesian tasks, you will be shown a series of 9 different Bayesian scenarios. You will be asked to answer reasoning questions about the scenarios. The information needed to answer questions about the scenario will be displayed using either text, visualization or a combination of both. At the bottom of the page will be a button labeled "I'm ready to see the question". Please take as much time as you want to understand the visualization and text. When you are ready to answer a few questions based on the information presented, please click the "I'm ready to see the question" button.<br><br>

The visualization and text will remain on the page with the questions and a word selection task will appear.
You will have to attempt the word selection task while answering the two reasoning questions. Your priority should <b>always be </b> to answer both of the questions correctly. Once you are confident with your answers, press "Submit". You will have the chance to undergo a trial round before starting the first Bayesian task. <br><br>

After each task, you will be asked to fill a short <b> questionaire</b> about your experience. Please answer all the questions to the best of your ability.
